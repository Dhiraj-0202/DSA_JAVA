    "Calorie Requirement (how many calories the user needs daily).\n",
    "Dietary Restrictions (any food restrictions like no meat, no gluten, etc.).\n",
    "It contains a method display_profile() to display user details in a clean format.\n",
    "Purpose: It acts as a blueprint to create a user profile for the nutrition engine..</li>\n",

    "This class captures the meal information like:\n",
    "Name of the Meal (Salad, Grilled Chicken, Pasta, etc.).\n",
    "Calories, Protein, Carbs for each meal.\n",
    "Category to define if the meal is Vegan, Vegetarian, or Non-Vegetarian.\n",
    "It contains a method display_meal() to display the meal details.\n",
    "Purpose: It acts as a blueprint to store meal information in the system..</li>\n",

    "This class is responsible for creating a meal plan for the user based on:\n",
    "Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.\n",

    "This class is used to create a node for the Binary Search Tree (BST).\n",

    "<li>⁠ ⁠DietaryBST Class (Binary Search Tree)\n",
    "This is the core of our project where we:\n",
